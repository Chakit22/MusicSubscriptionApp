A single song can have multiple versions (for example, deluxe editions, live recordings, and
remix versions), performed by either the same or different artist. Different versions of the
same song are released on different albums.

so artist#title#album will always be unique. Even if a two songs by the same name are performed by two same artists their album name will be different.
